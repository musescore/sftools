### sf3convert

Utilities for SoundFont files.

* compress sound font files with ogg vorbis for use with [MuseScore](http://musescore.org)
* convert to "C" for embedding


### Compilation

#### Dependencies

* Qt >= 5.6
* libsdnfile
* libogg
* libvorbis

```
$ make release
```

### Usage Example:

This compresses the Fluid sound font from 148 MBytes to 20 MBytes.

    sf3convert -z FluidR3.SF2 mops.sf3

**The compressed sound font has the major version number 3. Its non standard
and can be used only (so far) by [MuseScore](http://musescore.org), [Calf-Fluidsynth](http://calf-studio-gear.org/), [Carla](http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Carla), [LMMS](https://lmms.io/), [Polyphone](https://www.polyphone-soundfonts.com/), [Qsynth](https://qsynth.sourceforge.io/), and [Qtractor](https://qtractor.sourceforge.io/).**


### TODO:
Stereo samples are compressed as two single streams instead of compressing
them as stereo ogg vorbis streams. This may be less optimal.
